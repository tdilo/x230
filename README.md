## Misc configuration files for Thinkpad X230

This repository contains a dump of my configuration files and tweaks for a
Thinkpad X230 running Arch Linux. YMMV on other models and distributions.

Main focus of the configuration is to keep power consumption low; At 10%
display brightness and with an idle wifi connection, my machine consumes around
6 Watts when idle with only i3 and i3status running. With the TN panel, a white
background saves around 400 mW.
